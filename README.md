# Arthena_Challenge

## Two parser scripts are included. One is in python, another one is javascript.

## parser.py works with python v2.7.
 	run this file by 'python parser.py'

## parser.js works with Node.js v8.5.0, output is written into the console.
	run this file by 'node parser.js'

## You can see my commit history of each step in the parser.py. 
The parser.js is quite similar, so I just commit it once.

## If you have any other requirement, please let me know.
Thank you.
